ðŸŽ“ Web Development Student | Passionate about AI and Machine Learning

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alan, and I am currently a Web Development student at OpenClassrooms. I am looking for a dynamic and innovative company where I can complete my apprenticeship and thus begin my professional training.

A few things to know about me:

ðŸ’» Web Development: My training at OpenClassrooms allows me to acquire solid skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many other web technologies. I particularly enjoy creating modern and responsive user interfaces and testing the limits of web languages.

ðŸ§  Machine Learning & Python: Alongside my studies, I have a passion for application development and Machine Learning. Python is my language of choice, and I spend a lot of time learning and perfecting my skills in this truly fascinating field.

ðŸŒŒ Astronomy & Physics: I am also passionate about astronomy and physics. I love exploring the universe and understanding the laws that govern it. This scientific curiosity drives me to always learn more and stay at the forefront of knowledge in these areas.

I am convinced that the combination of my technical skills in web development and my passion for Machine Learning and science will allow me to contribute significantly to your team. I am motivated, curious, and always ready to take on new challenges.

Feel free to contact me if you have an apprenticeship opportunity or just want to chat about our shared passions!
